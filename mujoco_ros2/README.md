# :bridge_at_night: MuJoCo - ROS2

This package enables a basic MuJoCo simulation environment with ROS2 communication channels for controlling a robot. It publishes a `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState` topic containing the position, velocity, and effort of the joints, and accepts commands via a `std_msgs::Float64MultiArray` topic. It can run in `POSITION`, `VELOCITY`, or `TORQUE` mode which can be set as a parameter in a launch file.

## :floppy_disk: Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have ROS2 and MuJoCo installed on your system.

1. **Install ROS2:**
   
   Follow the [ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) for your operating system.

2. **Install MuJoCo:**
   
   Download and install MuJoCo from the [official website](https://mujoco.org/).

   Mine is installed in `/opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0`

   Next, modify your `.bashrc` file:
   ```
   gedit ~/.bashrc
   ```
   Add the following lines of code at the bottom:
   ```
   export MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH=/opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0/bin
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   Change all instances of `opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0` to match your installation location, and your version.

4. **Install GLFW:**
```
   sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```

### Building the Project

In the `src/` directory of your ROS2 workspace, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Woolfrey/mujoco_ros2
```
Your directory structure should look something like this:
```
ros2_workspace/
├── build/
├── install/
├── log/
└── src/
    └── mujoco_ros2/
        ├── include/
        ├── launch/
        ├── model/
        ├── src/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── package.xml
        └── README.md
```

In `CMakeLists.txt` you need to tell the compiler where to find the MuJoCo header files:
```
set(MUJOCO_PATH "/opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0") # UPDATE THIS TO YOUR MUJOCO PATH
include_directories(${MUJOCO_PATH}/include/mujoco)                                                  # MuJoCo header files
include_directories(${MUJOCO_PATH}/include)                                                         # Additional MuJoCo header files
link_directories(${MUJOCO_PATH}/lib)                                                                # Location of MuJoCo libraries
```
As noted above, mine is installed in `/opt/mujoco/mujoco-3.2.0` but you should change it to match your directory and version.

Navigate back to the root of your ROS2 workspace and build the package:
```
colcon build --packages-select mujoco_ros2
```
Source the ROS2 workspace:
```
source install/setup.bash
```

## :rocket: Launching the Simulation

There is a simple launch file that demonstrates how to run it in `mujoco_ros2/launch/example.py`. It launches the node:
```
    mujoco = Node(
        package    = "mujoco_ros2",
        executable = "mujoco_node",
        output     = "screen",
        arguments  = [xmlScenePath],
        parameters = [   
                        {"joint_state_topic_name" : "joint_state"},
                        {"joint_command_topic_name" : "joint_commands"},
                        {"control_mode" : "VELOCITY"},
                        {"simulation_frequency" : 1000},
                        {"visualisation_frequency" : 20},
                        {"camera_focal_point": [0.0, 0.0, 0.25]},
                        {"camera_distance": 2.5},
                        {"camera_azimuth": 135.0},
                        {"camera_elevation": -20.0},
                        {"camera_orthographic": True}
                     ]
    )
```

The `argument = [xmlScenePath]` requires a valid MuJoCo xml file. For this example, it utilizes the local `model/scene.xml` file. There are lots of other models in the [MuJoCo Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) that you can use.

The `parameter` argument can be changed based on your preferences:
| Argument | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| joint_state_topic_name | This sets the name of the topic for the joint state publisher. Your ROS2 robot control node should subscribe to this topic as a `sensor_msgs/JointState`. |
| joint_command_topic_name | This sets the topic name that the node will subcsribe to for receiving joint commands. Your ROS2 robot control node should publish to this as a `std_msgs/Float64MultiArray`. |
| control_mode | This is a string that sets what type of commands are sent to the joints. Options are POSITION, VELOCITY, or TORQUE. |
| simulation_frequency | This is used to set the update rate of the underlying MuJoCo simulation. |
| visualisation_frequency | This is how fast the 3D rendering should be refreshed. In general it should be much lower than the simulation frequency. |
| camera_focal_point | A position in the 3D world that the camera looks at. |
| camera_distance | How far the camera is from the focal point. |
| camera_azimuth | A clockwise rotation of the camera viewing angle. |
| camera_elevation | The tilt of the angle from the ground plane. |
| cmaera_orthographic | Controls the type of projection. Can be `True` or `False`. |

After you've installed the package, and sourced the workspace, you can run:
```
ros2 launch mujoco_ros2 example.py
```

And you should see the following:

   <img src="doc/example.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="Diagram showing results of example launch file."/>
   <br>
   <em>Figure 3: Using the launch example generates a 2-link planar robot, with ROS2 communication channels.</em>
</p>

You can check the topics are available, and see the output for the joint state being published:
```
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /joint_state
```

You can alter the parameters to your liking.

> [!NOTE]
> So far I've only tested VELOCITY mode robustly. TORQUE mode did work, but my controller hadn't been properly tuned. It will be double-checked in the near future.
